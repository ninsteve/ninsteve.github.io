My name is <strong>Steffen W. R. Werner</strong> and I am postdoctoral associate
in the Department of Computer Science at the <a target="blank_"
href="https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/">Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences,
New York University</a>.
There I am working on projects involving scientific machine learning, numerical
linear algebra, model order reduction and optimization.
I obtained my doctoral degree from the Department of Mathematics at the <a
target="blank_" href="https://www.uni-magdeburg.de/en/">Otto von Guericke
University</a> in Magdeburg, Germany, while I work as a doctoral researcher in
the <a target="blank_" href="https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/csc">
Computational Methods in Systems and Control Theory group</a> at the <a
target="blank_" href="https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/2316/en">Max Planck 
Institute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems</a> in Magdeburg.
During that time, I was an associated member of the German Research Foundation
(DFG) Research Training Group <a target="blank_"
