## Context-Aware Learning of Low-Dimensional Controllers ##
  
<p class="text-block">
<img class="projectpiccalearn" src="/images/context_aware_learning.png"
alt="Context-aware Learning Flow Chart">
The general idea of context-aware learning is to directly learn the task of
interest rather than some generic descriptions of the occurring dynamics, which
usually demands for lots of data and computational resources to learn an
accurate representation of the underlying physics.
Thereby, it is possible to restrict to the task-relevant dynamics,
which are often simpler than the full underlying physics, such that the data
requirements for the training only scale with the task.
In this project, we consider the task of learning controllers for dynamical
systems from given data.

## Data-Driven Reduced-Order Modeling of Mechanical Systems ##
  
<p class="text-block">
<img class="projectpicddrom" src="/images/dd_rom.png"
alt="Structured Data-Driven Reduced-Order Modeling">
Data-driven reduced-order modeling is essential in the construction of compact,
high-fidelity models from frequency domain data.
While there exist already unstructured approaches for data-driven modeling from
data, it is of particular interest to retain the physical structure as in the
case of structure-preserving model reduction. The main problems arising here
are, first of all, to enforce the classical mechanical system structure,
which is typically lost in data obtained from the systemâ€™s transfer function
and second, to receive physically interpretable properties in the resulting
matrices such as positive definiteness of mass, damping and stiffness.
In this project, we develop extensions of the barycentric form to the
case of mechanical systems leading to the extension of known techniques to the
learning of structured models from frequency domain data such as the
AAA algorithm, the Loewner framework or vector fitting.

## Structure-Preserving Model Reduction for Mechanical Systems ##

<p class="text-block">
<img class="projectpicsomor" src="/images/mor_system_so.png"
alt="Second-Order System MOR">
For the construction of complex mechanical structures such as bridges, 
buildings, or vehicles, the use of computer models is nowadays indispensable. 
Such computer models are typically used to simulate and, if necessary, to 
optimize the oscillation behavior. For instance, such an optimization is useful 
to suppress and damp undesired oscillations. Taking into account the 
input-output structure of the system, modeling of such mechanical structures 
typically leads to dynamical systems described by second-order ordinary 
differential equations.
Often the system dimension (i. e., the number of masses) is very large. The aim 
of model reduction is now to approximate the original system by a much smaller 
one to save a huge amount of computational resources during evaluation of the 
model.
In this project we want to develop new model reduction techniques for 
second-order mechanical systems that also preserve certain system properties 
like dissipativity.

## Robust Flow Control via HINFBT ##

<p class="text-block">
<img class="projectpicstabflow" src="/images/hinfbt.png"
alt="Flow Stabilization">
For the efficient stabilization of flows, controllers of small orders are 
needed, which also bridge the gap between approximation and model, or
model and reality.
While there are established construction formulas for robust stabilizing 
controllers, those usually lead to controllers described by systems of 
differential equations of the same size as the original system, which makes
real time control of the system impossible.
In this project, we aim for the construction of such low-order robust 
stabilizing controllers by employing LQG- and H-Infinity-based model reduction 
methods and controller theory.

## MORLAB &ndash; Model Order Reduction LABoratory ##

<p class="text-block">
<img class="projectpicmorlab" src="/images/morlab_logo.png" alt="MORLAB Logo">
<b>MORLAB</b>, the <b>M</b>odel <b>O</b>rder <b>R</b>eduction <b>LAB</b>oratory
toolbox, is a collection of MATLAB and Octave routines for model order reduction 
of dense linear time-invariant continuous-time systems. The toolbox contains 
model reduction methods for standard, descriptor and second-order systems based 
on the solution of matrix equations. Therefore, also spectral projection based 
methods for the solution of the corresponding matrix equations are included.
